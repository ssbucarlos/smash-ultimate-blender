## System Requirements
The plugin supports 64-bit versions of Blender 4.0 or later for Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Apple machines with M1 processors are also supported.
If your computer can run a supported version of Blender but fails to install the plugin, please make an issue in [issues](https://github.com/ssbucarlos/smash-ultimate-blender/issues).

## Legacy Blender Version Support
* Check the releases page for older versions of the plugin that work for the legacy blender version.
* This started with 3.6 LTS, older versions of blender require digging through the commit history and finding a really old version that worked with that old blender version.

## Uninstalling / Updating
TO REMOVE: First "Disable" the plugin, then restart blender, then you can hit "Remove" to uninstall. Then you can install the newest version.

## Special Thanks
* SMG for creating SSBH_DATA_PY, which without it none of this would be possible https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/ssbh_data_py
(and also for providing alot of the reference code for how to use the library, most of which was shamelessly stolen and implemented here)
(and also for making CrossMod which was a great reference for how smash ultimate shaders work, from the CrossMod render code certain details such as which step of the shading process do vertex colors get factored in was used)
* The Rokoko plugin https://github.com/Rokoko/rokoko-studio-live-blender for being the reference used for the UI code used in this project.
